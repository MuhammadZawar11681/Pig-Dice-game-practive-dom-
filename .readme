# Pig Dice Game

Pig is a simple and fun dice game that can be played with two or more players. The goal is to be the first to reach a certain number of points, usually 100.

## Basic Rules

### Objective

Be the first player to reach 100 points.

### Gameplay

- Players take turns rolling a die as many times as they choose, adding up the total of their rolls.
- A player's turn ends when they either:
  - Roll a 1 (this is called "pigging out"), which results in losing all points accumulated on that turn.
  - Decide to "hold", which means they add the points they rolled that turn to their total score and pass the die to the next player.

### Scoring

- If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing for that turn and their turn ends.
- If a player rolls any other number (2-6), they add that number to their turn total and can choose to either roll again or hold.
- When a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their overall score.

### Winning the Game

- The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds 100 points.
- If a player reaches 100 points during their turn, the game ends immediately, and that player is declared the winner.

## Example Turn

- **Player 1** rolls a 3, chooses to roll again, rolls a 5, and then rolls a 1. Player 1 scores 0 points for that turn and passes the die to Player 2.
- **Player 2** rolls a 4, chooses to roll again, rolls a 6, then decides to hold. Player 2 scores 10 points and adds it to their total score.

## Strategy Tips

- The risk of rolling a 1 increases with each roll, so it’s often a good strategy to hold if you’ve accumulated a decent number of points in a turn.
- Balancing risk and reward is key. Deciding when to hold and when to keep rolling is the essence of the game’s strategy.
